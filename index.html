    <h2>Ride The Lightening Album</h2>
    <img src="images/album-2.png" alt="Ride The Lightning album cover">
    <p><strong>Ride the Lightning</strong> is the second studio album by American<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music" target="_blank"> heavy metal</a> band<a href="https:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallica" target="_blank"> Metallica</a>, released on July 27, 1984, by the independent record label<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaforce_Records" target="_blank"> Megaforce Records</a>. The album was recorded in three weeks with producer<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flming_Rasmussen"target="_blank"> Flemming Rasmussen</a> at the<a href="https:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Silence_Studios" target="_blank"> Sweet Silence Studios</a> in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen" target="_blank"> Copenhagen</a>, Denmark. The artwork, based on a concept by the band, depicts an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_chair" target="_blank"> electric chair</a> being struck by lightning flowing from the band logo. The title was taken from a passage in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King" target="_blank"> Stephen King's</a> novel <ahref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stand" target="_blank"> The Stand></a>. Although rooted in the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrash_metal" target="_blank"> thrash metal</a> genre, the album showcased the band's musical growth and lyrical sophistication. This was partly because bassist<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Burton" target="_blank"> Cliff Burton</a> introduced the basics of music theory to the rest ofthe band and had more input in the songwriting. Instead of relying heavily on  fast tpos as on its debut<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stand" target="_blank"> Kill All</a>, Metallica broadened its approach by ploying acoustic guitars, extended instrumentals, and more complex harmonies. The overall recording costs were paid by Metallica's European label<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_for_Nations" target="_blank"> Music for Nations</a> because Megaforce was unable to cover it. It was the last album to feature songwriting contributions from former lead guitarist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Mustaine" target="_blank"> Dave Mustaine</a>, and the first to feature contributions from his replacent, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Hammett" target="_blank">Kirk Hammett</a>.

  <p>Ride the Lightning received positive response from music critics, who saw it as a more ambitious effort than its predecessor. Metallica promoted the album on the Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang European<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ride_the_Lightning_Tour"target="_blank"> tour</a> in late 1984, and on its North American leg in the first half of 1985. The band performed at major music festivals such as<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsters_of_Rock" target="_blank"> Monsters of Rock</a> and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_on_the_Green" target="_blank"> Day on the Green</a> later that year. Two months after its release, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektra_Records" target="_blank"> Elektra Records</a> signed Metallica to a multi-year deal and reissued the album. Ride the Lightning peaked at number 100 on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_200"target="_blank"> Billboard 200</a> with no radio exposure. Although 75,000 copies were initially pressed for the American market, the album sold half a million by Novber 1987. It was certified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIAA_certification" target="_blank"> 6Ã— platinum</a> by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIAA_certification" target="_blank"> Recording Industry Association of America</a>(RIAA) in 2012 for shipping six million copies in the United States. Many rock publications have ranked Ride the Lightning on their best album lists, saying it had a lasting impact on the genre.
